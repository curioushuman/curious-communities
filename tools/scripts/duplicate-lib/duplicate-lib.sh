# NOTE: this is a WIP
# Currently all this script does is rename files and directories in an already copied module
# e.g. when I coped `members` to be `groups` I needed to change all the file names over
# An extenstion of this script might be to update the contents of the files too
# e.g. `member` to `group` in the files
